Create an application that allows the generation of test personal data in a chosen
quantity and additional information the user selects.
The application should include a form where the user can specify:
• the number of data entries to be generated
• the language for the generated data (at least 10 languages)
• additional fields to be generated besides the basic ones (possible options include ge-
nerating addresses, university names, countries of origin, and any other 5 arbitrary
fields).
By default, the generated person’s information includes first name, last name, and date of
birth.
In the application, using the FakeDataService service, generate and return a set of objects of
the Person class with the fields the user selects from the form. Use DTO.
The generated data list should be presented to the user as a table below the form (each
person represented in one row, with values of each field in separate columns).
The table must have headers describing in the language selected in the form.
Use the JavaFaker library (https://github.com/DiUS/java-faker) for data generation. Add
the dependency to the library using the build.gradle file. Make sure you have familiarized
yourself with the library documentation.
In case of errors, inform the user with an appropriate message below the form.
Prepare an aesthetically pleasing appearance for the server response.
